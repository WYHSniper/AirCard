# Multiple cards and partial failures

[Back to the English guide](README.en.md) · [中文](MULTI-CARD.zh-CN.md) · [Troubleshooting by stage](TROUBLESHOOTING.en.md)

These instructions describe the current GUI and backend code, not hardware testing across every iPhone / iOS combination. On a first attempt, complete the flow with one card whose identity you have confirmed before expanding to several cards.

## What the card list remembers

AirCard saves **internal card identifiers**, not payment card numbers or a live inventory of the phone's Wallet. It loads saved records from the Mac at startup, then appends and saves newly detected identifiers during scanning.

| Item | After closing and reopening the app |
| --- | --- |
| Card identifiers and list order | Saved; records from older versions may also be imported. |
| Selection state | Not saved; loaded cards start selected. |
| Assigned images, image paths, and previews | Not saved; assign them again. Keep the source files on the Mac. |
| Association with a specific iPhone | Not grouped by device; the old list is not an inventory of a newly connected phone. |

Each row shows the product name and the card ending (`•••• 1234`) read from the Mac's Wallet cache, so several cards of the same product — five Platinum cards, for example — are told apart by the ending, not by position. The ending is the account's last digits; where Wallet exposes none, AirCard falls back to the device token ending, which is still unique per card, and the tooltip on the ending says which one you are looking at. A card with no ending at all (Apple Cash, transit passes, ID passes) says so and is identified by its card ID instead. If two rows still read identically — same product, same card ending, which is possible — those rows and only those rows add the Device Account Number ending and the date the card was added to Wallet, both of which differ per card. No expiration date is available: the Mac's Wallet cache does not carry one. Endings are read fresh from the cache each session and are never written to the saved card list.

**Card #1 / #2** are list positions, not bank names, payment card numbers, or reliable Wallet ordering. Do not infer identity from the number alone. During scanning, select one card at a time and watch for new entries; if the mapping is uncertain, resolve it before flashing. Do not copy identifiers from someone else's screenshot into **Add Manually**.

The code saves identifiers in `UserDefaults` and `~/.aircard_cards.json`, and also reads the legacy `~/.lumicards_cards.json`. These files do not back up original artwork. If old entries return after clearing the list and restarting, consider legacy record import rather than assuming a fresh phone scan succeeded.

## Assign different images to different cards

1. Check that the connection area identifies the intended iPhone. Stop scanning to keep the list stable for this batch.
2. Click **Deselect All**, then select the target cards individually.
3. Click each card or drop an image onto it to assign separate artwork. **Assigning an image automatically selects that card**, so check the selections again afterward.
4. Check the bottom `ready to flash` count and **Flash Skins (N Cards)**. Only cards that are **selected and have an assigned image path** enter the batch.
5. Confirm the source images still open normally, then click **Flash Skins**. Inspect each card on the iPhone after completion.

For example, if A is selected with an image, B is selected without an image, and C has an image but is unselected, only A is processed. `ready to flash` means those configuration conditions are met; it does not validate the image or confirm successful phone writes.

## Use one image on several cards

Select the target cards and click **Set Skin for All…** to choose an image. “All” means **currently selected cards**. Unselected cards are not assigned the image, and their previous image assignments are not cleared.

For every card, use **Select All** before **Set Skin for All…**. For just two cards, use **Deselect All** and select those two first. Recheck `ready to flash` afterward.

## Buttons that are easy to confuse

| Action | What it actually does |
| --- | --- |
| Uncheck a card / **Deselect All** | Excludes cards from the next batch; assigned images remain in the current session. |
| Top-right × / **Remove skin** | Clears that card's pending image and path on the Mac; does not write original artwork to the phone. |
| Trash icon / **Remove from list** | Removes and saves the Mac's list entry; does not delete the payment card from the phone. |
| **Clear All** on the Apple Wallet tab | Clears and saves the Mac's current card list; does not delete Wallet cards, clear phone caches, or restore artwork. Stop scanning first when refreshing the list, since new log events can still append cards. |
| **Stop Scanning** | Stops the card-detection log process; it is not a stop-flashing or undo button. |

This table applies to **Apple Wallet**, not similarly named controls in the passcode theme creator.

## Handling a failure partway through

Eligible cards are processed in list order. **If a card's flashing process cannot launch or exits unsuccessfully, the batch stops before later cards. Earlier writes are not automatically rolled back.** A failed card may also contain some files that were already written.

For A → B → C, if A succeeds and B fails: A may already have changed, B needs inspection, and C has not been processed. The overall failure message does not mean that nothing changed.

1. In **Log**, find the last `Flashing card [n/total]` before failure, its error, and any preceding `Successfully updated …` entries. Do not rely on the progress percentage alone.
2. Address the connection, image, or cache issue using the [troubleshooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.en.md). Keep the original image files.
3. Click **Deselect All**, select only the failed card, confirm its image again, and retry. You do not need to reflash every card already reported as successful.
4. After that card succeeds, select the unprocessed cards and continue. Image assignments remain during the same session; after restarting the app, assign them again.
5. Close and reopen Wallet on the iPhone and inspect every card. If necessary, try restarting the phone and record the result; a restart does not guarantee restoration of old artwork.

The backend first tries a batch write of **one card's asset files**, then retries individual files if needed, followed by cleanup of two Wallet cache types. This provides no transaction across cards, automatic rollback, original-artwork backup, or restoration guarantee. Deleting a payment card from Wallet is not a recovery step in this guide.

- [aircard.py](../../aircard.py): `get_connected_device` chooses an available device; [aircard_backend.py](../../aircard_backend.py): `cmd_flash` asset writes, cache cleanup, and exit results.
- [Card backend tests](../../tests/test_card_flash.py) check that mocked write or cache failures do not report success. The multi-card stopping and persistence rules were checked in Swift source; this page does not present them as real-device validation.
